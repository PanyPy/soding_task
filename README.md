# README
It works as expected, you can create, edit, delete and list task (CRUD). I used bootstrap and font-awesome for a bit of style and scaffold for simplicity.
1. You have to click on Task (on the Menu), the link will redirect you to the list of Tasks.
2. If you want to create a new Task you must click on + New Task, then put the data and submit.
3. If you want to show, you must click the eye in the list.
4. If you want to update, you must select the pencil in the list.
5. If you want to delete, you must click the trash in the list and confirm the action.
I used rails framework with PostgreSQL DB.
I upload the project to Heroku  https://soding-task-jerson-paniagua.herokuapp.com (it will be able for 1 month, then I will delete)
